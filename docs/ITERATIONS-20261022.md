# Ten sequential iterations — 2026-10-22

Each iteration is validated and pushed before the next begins. These are source changes; no new binaries or native installation.

## 1. Connection lifecycle recovery

Initialization exits, output EOF, pipe errors and RPC timeouts now propagate typed recoverable failures, including events before a worker subscribes. Pending RPCs settle immediately; invalid executable/configuration errors retain their identity. Targeted transport/worker tests and build pass.
